        <p>Hello Hello Hello! This is past Michael speaking, welcome to the "About Me" section of my web portfolio. I'll
            follow this up with some fun facts and text about me, while other pages will hold my resume and projects
            I've done. Enjoy!</p>

        <h3>Quick crazy facts about me!</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I'm an Eagle Scout!</li>
            <li>I'm a Taurus!</li>
            <li>Pineapple belongs on Pizza!</li>
            <li>I'm from Elkhart, Indiana, near where Notre Dame is!</li>
        </ul>

        <p> I (Michael) am a second year Mechanical Engineering major, however I will be changing to Computer Science as
            it is more appealing to me.<br>
            When I'm not coding and studying, I live a relatively standard college life- I eat ramen and rice, I play
            some video games, and I don't get enough sleep.<br>
            I work hours at the SRC (Student Recreation Center) as a lifeguard to help "pay the bills", so to speak and
            that's a great time. I've lifeguarded for multiple years to this point, and it is a very valuable skill of
            mine.<br>
            My freshman year I was on the varsity swim team, however this year I have decided to put more focus on
            academics. I pride myself in staying fit and keeping good care of my wellbeing.<br>
            Anyway if you're still interested, click through some of the projects I've worked through, or check out my
            resume, and have a nice day!
